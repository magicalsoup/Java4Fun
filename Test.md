# Math Study Sheet!!!!

# Essential Skills (1)
> ## Simple Arithmetics
>> ### Addition / Subtraction
>>> | Expression | Equivalent|
>>> |:----------:|:---------:|
>>> | a + b | a + b |
>>> | (-a) + b | b - a |
>>> | a + (-b) | a - b |
>>> | (-a) + (-b) | -(a + b) |
>>> | a - b | a - b|
>>> | a - (-b) | a + b |
>>> | (-a) -(-b) | (-a) + b|

>> ### Multiplication / Division    
>>> | Signs | Outcome |
>>> |:-----:|:-------:|
>>> | a * b | Positive |
>>> | (-a) * b | Negative |
>>> | a * (-b) | Negative |
>>> | (-a) * (-b) | Positive |

>> ### BEDMAS / PEMDAS
>>> Follow BEDMAS for order of operations if there are more than one operation   

>>> | Letter | Meaning |   
>>> |:------:|:-------:|   
>>> | B / P | Bracket / Parentheses |    
>>> | E | Exponent |   
>>> | D | Divison |   
>>> | M | Multiplication |   
>>> | A | Addition |   
>>> | S | Subtraction |   

> ## Interval Notation
>> A notation that represents an interval as a pair of numbers.     
>> The numbers in the interval represent the endpoint. E.g. **[x > 3, x E R]**   

>> | Symbol | Meaning |
>> |:------:|:-------:|
>> | (a, b) | Between but not including ```a``` or ```b```, you also use this for ```∞``` |
>> | [a, b] | Inclusive |
>> | a ∪ b | Union (or) |
>> | a ∩ b | Intersection (and) |

> ## Pythgorean Theorem
>> let a be the adjecant and b be the opposite, and c be the hypotenuse.   
>> a<sup>2<\sup> + b<sup>2<\sup> + c<sup>2<\sup>
 
> ## Operations with Rationals
>> Q = { &frac(ab); | a, b &epsilon; Z, b != 0 }
>> Any operations with rationals, there are 2 sets of rules    
>>> 1. ```Rules for operations with integers```
>>> 2. ```Rules for operations with fractions```
>> To Add / subtract rationals, find common denominator and then add / subtract numerator   
>> To Multiply rationals, first reduce the fraction to their lowest terms, then multiply numerators and denominators   
>> To Divide rationals, multiply them by the reciprocal
